# Vimage AI Studio Frontend

An opinionated Vue 3/Vite frontend for the Vimage AI Studio experience. The app bundles media tooling, PrimeVue components, and audio/video workflows into a single dashboard that talks to a JSON API backend and an experimental FFmpeg/ComfyUI helper.

## Features
- **Authentication & profile management** with JWT-based session handling and guarded routes.
- **Media library** views for browsing, uploading, and editing video content (including vid2vid and Deforum editors).
- **Soundscape creator** that streams audio generated by the backend FFmpeg/ComfyUI pipeline.
- **UI kit playground** powered by PrimeVue examples (tables, forms, dialogs, charts, overlays, menus, and more).
- **Developer utilities** for webcam capture, FFmpeg web transcoding, modal/video experiments, and Deforum UI previews.
- **Responsive layout** built on PrimeFlex, PrimeIcons, and extensive PrimeVue component registration.

## Tech Stack
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) dev/build tooling
- [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) + [PrimeFlex](https://primeflex.org/) + [PrimeIcons](https://primefaces.org/primeicons/)
- [Vue Plyr](https://github.com/redxtech/vue-plyr) and [vue-audio-visual](https://github.com/staskobzar/vue-audio-visual) for media playback
- Optional Node helper in `backend/` for streaming audio via FFmpeg and ComfyUI

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js **18+** and npm
- A running API server compatible with the routes used in `src/services`
- (Optional) Docker if you prefer containerized development

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Set the URLs in `.env`:
   - `VUE_APP_BASE_URL`: public URL where the frontend is served (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`).
   - `VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL`: base URL of the JSON API (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`).

### Running the app
- Development server with debug logging:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Production build preview with Vite dev server:
  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```
- Build static assets for deployment:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Start the experimental audio helper (requires ComfyUI/FFmpeg):
  ```bash
  npm run api
  ```

### Docker workflow
1. Ensure Docker is running.
2. Build and start the environment (frontend + helpers):
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. The `ffmpeg-worker` service can be scaled to handle concurrent audio streams:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --scale ffmpeg-worker=6
   ```

## Development Notes
- Auth-protected routes use `meta.requiresAuth`; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.
- Auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, password reset) are guarded with `meta.handleAuth` to redirect authenticated users to the library.
- PrimeVue components and directives are registered globally in `src/main.js` so they are available throughout the app.
- When using the audio streaming page (`/soundscape`), ensure the backend helper and ComfyUI workflow defined in `backend/audio-workflow.json` are running.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests with bug fixes or enhancements. Please keep new components consistent with the existing PrimeVue/PrimeFlex patterns and prefer the services in `src/services` when talking to the API.
